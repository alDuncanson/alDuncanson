# Hey, I'm Al

I care about free and open source software because I believe in decentralizing and democratizing access to powerful tools.

Recently, I've been exploring P2P technologiesâ€”largely sparked by discovering [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/), which opened my eyes to what's possible when devices connect directly without intermediaries.

I'm studying and experimenting with these ideas through [Ginseng](https://github.com/alDuncanson/Ginseng), a native file sharing tool that lets you move files between devices with zero servers, zero accounts, and zero surveillance.

Just pure cryptographic trust between devices.
